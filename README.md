# BlazoryQueryBuilder
Dynamic query builder using Blazor, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework

This is a work in progress.

- Point the application at a database
- Read the database entities
- Dynamically build simple EF query expressions in the UI using Blazor components (MudBlazor)
- Pass the query expression to EF to execute the query and view results
