# BlazoryQueryBuilder
A MudBlazor-based dynamic query builder for Entity Framework.
   
This is a work in progress.  

- Point the application at a database and read the database entities
- Dynamically build simple EF query expressions in the UI
- Pass the query expression to EF to execute the query and view results
