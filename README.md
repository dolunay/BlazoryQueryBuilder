# BlazoryQueryBuilder
Dynamic query builder using Blazor, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework

Work in progress.  I haven't put much time into this very recently, but all of the core building blocks should be basically in place to do the following:

- Point the application at a database
- Read the database entities
- Be able to dynamically build an EF query expression in the UI using Blazor and the EF API.
